# *The Quantum Computer Journey*
I'm been interested in Quantum Computers since the early 2000s. After 5 years of trying to build qubits I left the academic world and wanted to solve more real world business problems with a shorter time to market horizon. 

BUT in October 2018 Gartner wrote a [_Top 10 strategic technology trends for 2019_](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2019) blog post. This inspired me to pick up the subject again add see if it has become more mature. This site is my personal space to save notes and store links to what I find interesting.

## Blog posts
#### Cats, Qubits, and Teleportation (Holly Cummins, InfoQ jun 2018)
A 3 part blog post which gives a good high level introduction to the Quantum Information field. [Part 1](https://www.infoq.com/articles/quantum-computing-intro-one), [Part 2](https://www.infoq.com/articles/quantum-computing-algoritms-two), [Part 3](https://www.infoq.com/articles/quantum-computing-applications-three)

## *Books*
#### Practical Quantum Computing for Developers (Vladimir Silva, Apress dec 2018)
This is the book I'm reading at the moment, and it feels easy to read and follow. I will come back with more detailed thoughts.
