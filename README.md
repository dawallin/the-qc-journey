*The Quantum Computer Journey*
I'm been interested in Quantum Computers since the early 2000s. After 5 years of trying to build qubits I left the academic world and wanted to solve more real world business problems with a shorter time to market horizon. BUT in October 2018 Gartner wrote a [_Top 10 strategic technology trends for 2019_](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2019) blog post. This inspired me to pick up the subject again add see if it has become more mature. This site is my personal space to save notes and store links to what I find interesting.
